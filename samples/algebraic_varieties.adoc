== Algebraic Varieties

Let $\CC^n$ denote complex $n$-space with coordinates
$(z_1, \ldots, z_n)$,
let $f(z_1, \ldots, z_n)$  be a polynomial of degree $d$ with complex
coefficients,  and let $X$ be the set of solutions to the equation
$f(z) = 0$.  Such a set  an _affine algebraic hypersurface
of degree_ $d$:
a special kind _affine algebraic set_  A general affine
variety is the set of common zeroes of an arbitrary collection of polynomials.
By two deep theorems in commutative algebra (the Hilbert Nullstellensatz
and the fact that polynomial rings are Noetherian) we know that a finite number
of polynomials is sufficient to define any algebraic set.  If an
algebraic set $X$ can be written as the union of two algebraic
sets, $X = X_1 \cup X_2$, we say that it is _reducible_.
An algebraic set that is not reducible is called _irreducble_
and we say that the set is an _algebraic variety_.

Again,
there is a connection with commutatiive algebra.  Let
$I(X)$ be the set of polynomials that vanish on $X$.  It is an
ideal in the ring of polynomials $k[z_1, \ldots, z_n]$. Then $X$
is a variety if and only if $I(X)$ is a prime ideal.  Any algebraic
set  can be written as a union of irreducibel varieities.  This
decompositon is analogous to the factorization of a number
into to primes, or to writing an ideal as an intersection of
primary ideals.

=== Examples of affine varieties

Let us look at examples.  The set
defined by $z_1 + \cdots + z_n = 0$  in $\CC^n$ is an affine
algebraic variety of degree one.  It is isomorphic to $\CC^{n-1}$.
The set defined by $z_1^2 + \cdots + z_n^2 =1$ is an affine
algebraic variety of degree two, a so-called _smooth quadric_.
It has dimension $n-1$.  (How would we define dimension?)
The set $X$ defined by $z_1^2 + \cdots + z_n^2 = 0$ is also a quadric:
this is the generic term for a variety of degree two.  IT is a _cone_,
since the line joining the origin to a point $P$ of $X$  is also in $X$.
The origin is a _singular point_ of $X$: it looks different
from the other points, and that difference can be made precise.
(Try to formulate a definition that distinguishes "ordinary" from
"singular" points).  The notions
of smooth and singular are discussed below.

To make the notion of number of intersection point precise,
consider a parameterization $t \mapsto \ell(t)$ of a line $L$.
Let $f(z) = 0$ be the equation of $X$.  The composition
$f(\ell(t)$ is a polynomial function of one variable.  Its degree
is a measure of the number of points of intersection.

Is it independent of the radius, up to homeomorphism?  Let $X'$ be the variety defined

--

For another class of examples, consider the polynomial equation $f(z,w) = 0$,
where $f$ has degree $d$.   The solution set $X$ is a _plane algebraic curve_.
Consider, the degree two case, say the _conic_  $f(z,w) =z^2 +(w-1)^2 - 1$.
Fix a point of $X$, say $A = (0,0)$.  Given $P \in X$, let $L$
be the line joining $A$ to $P$, and note that $L$ meets $X$ _only_
in $A$ and $P$.  Let $\Pi$ be the plane tangent to $X$ at $B = (0,2)$,
and let $Q$ be the intersection of $L$ and $\Pi$.  As  $P$ approaches $A$,
the point $Q$ approaches infinity.  Let $\bar \Pi$ be the _Riemann sphere_:
the one-point compactification of the space of complex numbers:
\[
  S^2 = \bar \Pi = \Pi \cup \set{\infty}.
\]



Then the map
$P \mapsto Q$ is a homeomorphism
of $X$ with its image in $\bar \Pi$,  It turns out the image is
consists of the Riemann sphere minus two points.  This space is
holomorphically isomorhpic to $\CC^*$.

$X  \map \bar\Pi$
and show that that homeomorphism is algebraic.._

Consider next the plane curve $C$ with equation
$z^3 + w^3 = 1$. It is an example of
an  _affine elliptic curves_  These play an especially important role in the development
of algebraic geometry and also number theory,  e.g., Andrew Wiles'
proof the Fermat theorem.   Because $C$ is of degree three, the
argement give earlier does not a apply, and we cannot conclude
that $C$ is isomorphic to a punctured Riemann sphere.   Nonetheless,
there is information that we can extract from the line-drawing
construction. Let $A$ be any point of $C$, and let $\Pi$ be a plane not
containing $A$.  The line $L = AP$ generally intersections $C$ in
two points,  $P$ and $P'$.  Map these to $Q = L\cap \bar \Pi$.  The
result is a 2-to-1 map of $C$ to $\bar \Pi$.  If the line $L$ is tangent
to $C$ at $P$, the the map is 1-to-1 at $P$.  Such a point is a
_branch point_ of the map.  _We conclude that the cubic curve
$z^3 + w^3 = 1$ is a 2-to-1 branched cover of an open set in $\bar \Pi$._

Here is another way of constructing a 2-to-1 branched cover.  Let $g(z)$
be a polynomial of degree $d$, and consider the affine algebraic curve $X$
with equation $w^2 = g(z)$.  Consider the projection of $\CC^2$
onto the $z$-axis.  This map induces a map
$X \map \CC$ which is of degree two: the inverse image of a "generic" point
consist of two distinct points, namely, the square roots of $f(z)$.  When
$f(z) = 0$, the inverse image consists of a single point.   The set of roots
of $f$ is the _branch locus_.

When $g(z)$ is of degree three or four, then the affine curve $w^2 = g(z)$
is an elliptic curve. The line-drawing construction still applies, except that
the point $A$ is the point at infinity, and so the lines drawn are vertical.
In this case se see that the image of the line-drawing map (projection)
is the complex plane, that is, the Riemann sphere minus a point.

=== Singular points and manifold structure

The variety $X$ defined by a single equation
is a _hypersurface_.  Suppose for a moment that the gradient of $f$
is nonzero at a point $a$ of $X$.  Then (by the holomorphic implicit
function theorem),  there is a neighborhood
$U$ of $a$ and a parametrization $u: U' \map U \subset X$ where (a) $U'$ is a neighborhood
in $\CC^{n+1}$, (b) $u$ is a homeomorphism of $U$ and $U'$, and (c),
$\nabla u(b) \ne 0$ for all $b \in U'$.  We say that components $u_i$ of $u$
are _local coordinates_ on $U$, and we say that the points of $U$ are _smooth_.
If all points of $X$ are smooth, we say that $X$ is smooth. This is synonymous
with being a manifold.   If all derivatives of $f$ vanish at $a$, then there exist
no local coordinates, and the point in question is said to be _singular_.  The origin in
$\CC^2$ is  a singular point of the hypersurfaces $xy = 0$, $y^2 =  x^2 + x^3 = 0$,
and $y^2 = x^3$.  These singularities have names: the first two are _nodes_,
and the last is a _cusp_.



There is, by the way, no mystery about how local coordinates are constructed.
If $a$ is a point of $X$, then there is an $i$ such that $\partial f/\partial z_i(a) \ne 0$.
Consider the projection "deletion of the $i$-th coordinate",
\[
  p_i: \CC^n \map \CC^{n-1},
\]
given by
\[
   p_i(z_1, \ldots, z_n) = (z_1,\ldots,z_{i-1},z_{i+1},\ldots z_n),
\]
where $p_1(z) = (z_2, \ldots, z_n)$ and $p_n(z) = (z_1, \ldots, z_{n-1})$.
The there is a small neighboorhood $U$ of $a$ such that $p_i$ is
a homeomorphism of $U$ onto its image $U'$. The restriction
of $p_{i}^{-1}$ to a $U'$ is the sought-after local coordinate.
Local coordinates can always be constructed in this way, as the
inverses of projections.



=== Projective space

An affine algebraic curve is never compact (give a proof!).  We can
compactify such an object in various ways, but the most natural
way is to take the topological closure in complex projective 2-space.
Complex projective $n$-space, denoted by $\CC\PP^n$,
is the set of lines through the origin
in complex $(n+1)$-space.  Thus it is the same as the quotient
of the space $\CC^{n+1} - \set{0}$ by the action of the
group $\CC^* = \CC - \set{0}$,
where the action is given by the dilations $f_\lambda(Z) = \lambda Z$,
for $\lambda \in \CC^*$ and $Z \in \CC^{n+1} - \set{0}$.

A point $[Z]$ in $\CC\PP^n$ is an equivalence class of vectors
$Z' \in \CC^{n+1} - \set{0}$ under the relation $Z' \sim \lambda Z$,
where $\lambda \ne 0$.  Any one these $Z$'s including $Z$
itself, is said to be a _homogeneous coordinate vector_ of the
point $[Z]$.

Consider the set
\[
  U_i = \sett{ [Z] \in \CC\PP^n }{ Z_i \ne 0}
\]
If the condition $Z_i \ne 0$ holds for any $Z \in [Z]$,
it holds for all $Z \in [Z]$.  Thus $U_i$ is a well-defined
subset of projective space.  Since it is defined by
the negation of an equation, it is an open set.  These
sets cover projective space, and constitute its _standard cover_.
(Why do they cover $\CC\PP^n$?)

The open sets $U_i$ are biholomorphic to $\CC^n$ via the map
that sends a homogeneous coordinate vector to the vector
of ratios $Z_j/Z_i$ for $j \ne i$.  The ratios are _affine
coordinates_ on the $U_i$.

Consider now the complement of $U_i$ in $\CC\PP^n$.  This is
the closed set $Z_i$, which we can identify with $\CC\PP^{n-1}$.
Thus we have the decompostion
\[
  \CC\PP^n \cong \CC^n \cup \CC\PP^{n-1}
\]
into disjoint open sets, one open and one closed. When $n = 1$, this decomposition
is
\[
  \CC\PP^1 \cong \CC \cup \set{\text{point}}.
\]
Thus $\CC\PP^1$ is the same as the one point compactification of $\RR^2$.
Using stereographic projection, we identify this compactificaton as the
two-sphere, $S^2$.  One can use this description to present $\CC\PP^1$
in another way. as the 2-disk $D^2  = \sett{ x \in \RR^2 }{ ||x|| \le 1 }$
with its boundary $S^1 = \sett{ x \in \RR^2 }{ ||x|| = 1 }$ identified to a point.
That is, we have found the cell decomposition of $\CC\PP^1$.  If one is
familiar with cellular homology, the cell decomposition gives the homology.
The boundary of the only two-cell is a linear combination of one-cells, of which
thee are none.  Thus the two-cell $D^2$ is a generator of $H_2(S^2,\ZZ)$.  It is
the fundamental homology class.  There are no one-cells in this decomposition,
so $H_1(S^2) = 0$.  Finally, there is a single zero-cell which generates
the zeroth homology.

from the sphere to the quotation of the sphere by the relation._
--

The standard cover of projective space leads to its description as a complex manifold.
The archetype of a complex manifold of dimension $n$ is an open set $U$ in $\CC^n$,
for which one has the usual global coordinates $z_1, \ldots, z_n$.  A general
complex manifold $M$ is a topological space endowed with an open cover
$\set{U_\alpha}$ and homeomorphisms
\[
   f_\alpha: U_\alpha \map V_\alpha \subset \CC^n
\]
When $U_\alpha \cap U_\beta \ne \emptyset $,  the compositions

\[
  g_{\alpha\beta} = f_\alpha^{-1}\circ f_\beta:
\text{subset of $U_\beta$ } \map  \text{subset of $U_\alpha$ }
\]

are defined.  These are the _transition functions_.
These compositions are called _transition functions_.  They satisfy the
identities
\[
  g_{\alpha\beta}\circ g_{\beta\gamma} = g_{\alpha\gamma}.
\]
Since the domain
and range are open sets in $\CC^n$, it makes sense to require
them to be holomorphic.   and holomorphic.

The previous observation, which we make in the
context of an algebraic curve with charts coming from the parameterizations
given by projections onto the coordinate axes, is the starting point for
the abstract definition of a manifold.  We take as the given data a collection
of open sets $\set{U_\alpha}$ on a topological space $M$ and a set of
homeomorphisms $f_\alpha: U_\alpha \map V_\alpha$, where the
$V_\alpha$ are open sets in real or complex Euclidean space ($\RR^n$ or
$\CC^n$).  We assume that the transition functions are of a given category:
 diffeomorphisms, holomorphic diffeomorphisms, etc.
We assume also that they satisfy the cocycle condition $\eqref{eq:cocycle}$.  Then
we say that the charts define the structure of a differential manifold,
complex manifold, etc.


=== Projective varieties

Consider now a homogeneous polynomial $F(Z)$
of degree $d$.  Its zero-set $\tilde X$ in $\CC^{n+1} - \set{0}$ is invariant
under the $\CC^*$ action and so defines a closed subset $X \subset \CC\PP^n$.
This set is by definition a _projective algebraic hypersurface_.


=== Stop here

Thus $\EEE$ is an algebraic curve.
In fact, it is a projective algebraic curve.   It is an algebraic curve of degree three,
meaning that a generic line $L$ intersects $\EEE$ in three points.  Any line
intersects $\EEE$ in three points counting multiplicity.  This fact allows
one to define the structure of a group on $\EEE$.  The addition law
is defined as follows.  Given points $A$ and $B$ on $\EEE$, let $L$ be the line
joining $A$ and $B$, and let $C$ be the third point in which $L$ cuts
$\EEE$.  If $C = (z,w)$, let $C' = (z,-w)$.  Then $A + B = C'$ is the
correct addition law.  It is easy to see that it is commutative, and it
is not hard to find additive inverses, once one has found the zero element.
Associativity is what is difficult to prove.

=== Topology
As a topological space, an elliptic curve is a torus, as
depicted in the figure below.  Its homology is generated by the two cycles
$\delta$ and $\gamma$.  Thus we have
\[
   H_1(\EEE, \ZZ) \cong \ZZ^2 = \ZZ\set{ \delta, \gamma}.
\]

FIGURE

=== Analytic Structure


An algebraic curve is also a _complex manifold_,
meaning that locally it is a manifold modeled on open sets in $\CC^n$.  An elliptic
curve is a complex manifold of dimension one, and so we may take the local
models to the disk, of radius $\epsilon$,
\[
  \Delta_\epsilon = \sett{ z \in \CC }{ |z| < \epsilon }.
\]  What this means
is that any point in $\EEE$ has a neighborhood which is parameterized by $\Delta$.
To see what this means in concrete terms, let $a$ be any point in $\CC$ which is
not a root of  the polynomial $p$.  Let $b$ be one of the two solutions of
the equation $w^2 = p(a)$.  Then $(a,b)$ is a point of $\EEE$.  Let
$\phi(z) = \sqrt{p(z)}$ be the branch of the square root such that $\phi(a) = b$.
Then $z \mapsto (z,\phi(z))$ is a parametrization of  a neighborhood of $(a,b)$
by a neighborhood of $a$.  This parametrization has nonzero derivative at
each point of the neighborhood and so is a diffeomorphism.  Notice that
$z \mapsto (z, \phi(z))$ is the inverse of projection of $\EEE$ onto the
$z$-axis.

When $a$ is a root of of $p(z)$, the construction just given does not give
a parametrization of a neighborhood of $(a,0$ on $\EEE$.
(Why?).  However, it turns out that the inverse of projection of $\EEE$
onto the $w$ axis does give the needed parametrization.  This is because
$p(z)$ has a simple zero at $z = a$ and so has an inverse function $q$.
Then
\[
  w \mapsto (z,w) = (q(w^2)),w)
\]
is the required parametrization.  Notice that it has nonzero derivative near $w = 0$.

The parametrization just given is in terms of complex variables, and
the parametrizing functions are complex analytic, i.e., holomorphic.
The complex variable $z$ can be written in terms of real and imaginary
parts as $z = u + \sqrt{-1}v$.  Then the parametrization can be written as
\[
   (u,v) \mapsto (u,v,\lambda(u,v), \mu(u,v),
\]
where
\[
  \phi(u,v) = \lambda(u,v)  + \sqrt{-1}\mu(u,v)
\]
is the decomposition into real and imaginary part.

So far we have treated the real and complex manifold structures on
an elliptic curve in terms of parameterizations.  The official treatment
is to use their inverse functions, which we refer to as _charts_.   If
\[
   z \mapsto (z,w) = (z,\phi(z))
\]
is a parameterization, then its inverse function
is just
\[
  (z,w) \in \EEE \mapsto z
\]
Via this chart we view $z$ as a  _function_ of points $(z,w)$ of $\EEE$.
We refer to $z$ as a _local coordinates_.


=== Singular Varieties

Consider an algebraic curve $M$ given by an equation $f(z,w) = 0$.
In the case of our elliptic curve, $f(z,w) = w^2 - p(z)$.
The  construction of charts or holomorphic parameterizations via
projections onto the axes and their inverses work in a neighborhood
of a point on $M$, provide that $\nabla f \ne 0$ at the point.
This is a consequence of the implicit function theorem.  A point
at which $\nabla f = 0$ is called _singular_.  A point at which
$\nabla f \ne 0$ is called _non-singular_, or _smooth_.  If all
points of $M$ are smooth, then we say that $M$ is smooth.  In that
case it is a complex manifold.

As an example, consider the elliptic curve $\EEE$
with equation $x^2 - y^2 + x^3 = 0$.  The origin is a singular point.  In
suitable analytic coordinates $u,v$ in a neighborhood of the origin,
$\EEE$ is given by the equation
\[
   u^2 - v^2 = 0
\]
Near the origin, $\EEE$ looks like the union of the lines $u = v$ and $u  = -v$.
This kind of singularity is called a _node_.  The other important type
of singularity for elliptic curves is the _cusp_, with equation $w^2 = z^3$.

Both the node and the cusp are singularities of multiplicity two.  To define
multiplicity, consider a polynomial equation $f(z,w) = 0$ with $(0,0)$ as solution.
The
\[
   f(z,w) = f_m(z,w) + f_{m+1}(z,w) + \cdots,
\]
where the $f_\ell(z,w)$ are homogeneous polynomials of degree $\ell \le d$
where $d$ is the degree of $f$.  The leading term has degree $m \ge 1$, and
that degree is by definition the multiplicity. The variety defined by
$f_m(z,w)$ is the _tangent cone_ of $f = 0$ at the given point.
Thus the multiplicity is just the degree of the tangent cone.

To understand the significance
of the tangent cone, consider  a parametric line
$\phi(t) =(\lambda t, \mu t)$, and let
 $f\circ\phi(t) = f(\lambda t , \mu t)$ be the composition with $f$.  Then
\[
   f\circ\phi(t) = f_m(\lambda.\mu)t^m + f_{m+1}(\lambda.\mu)t^{m+1} + \cdots
\]
If $(\lambda. \mu)$ is not a solution of $f_m(\lambda.\mu) = 0$, the
$f\circ\phi(t)$ vanshhes to order $m$. If $f_m(\lambda.\mu) = 0$, then
the composition vanishes to order greater than $m$.  In other words,
the tangent cone, viewed as a _projective_ variety, is the set of lines
which are "more tangent" to the variety at $p$ than a generic line through $p$.

For elliptic curves, the two kinds of tangent cones which appear are those
of the node and cusp, respectively.  The cones are a pair of distinct lines
in the first, and a doubled line in the second.


=== deRham Cohomology


Let $\phi$ be a differential form of degree $k$ on a differentiable
manifold $M$. If $x_1 \commadots x_n$ are local coordinates,
then $\phi$ is a linear combination of forms
\[
   dx_{i_1}\wedge \cdots \wedge dx_{i_k}
\]
with smooth functions as coefficients.  Recall that the wedge product
is skew-symmetric, i.e., $dx_i \wedge dx_j = - dx_j \wedge dx_i$.

Let us abbreviate this
"basic" differential form as $dx_I$, where $I = (i_1, \ldots, i_k)$
is a _multi-index_ of degree $k$.  Thus $\phi$ can be written
locally as
\[
   \phi = \sum_{I} f_I(x) dx_I.
\]
The exterior derivative of a form $\phi$ is defined by the formula
\[
   d\phi = \sum_{I,k} \frac{\partial f_I}{\partial x_k}(x)dx_k\wedge dx_I.
\]
Differentiation  is a symmetric operator, that is,
\[
   \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x \partial y} =  \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial y \partial x}.
\]
This fact, combined with the skew-symmetry of the wedge product, implies
that
\[
   d^2\phi = 0
\]
Consequently the vectors spaces
\[
   A^k(M) = \set{\text{differential $k$-forms}}
\]
fit together to form a complex,
\[
  A^\bullet = [A^0 \mapright{d} A^1 \mapright{d} A^2 \mapright{d} \cdots ]
\]
Let
\[
 Z^k = \sett{ \phi \in A^k }{ d\phi = 0 }.
\]
be the space of _closed forms_, and let
\[
 B^k = \sett{ d\psi }{ \psi \in A^{k-1} }.
\]
be the space of _exact_ forms.  Because $d^2\phi = 0$, the exact
forms are a subspace of the closed forms:
\[
   B^k \subset Z^k.
\]
Therefore the quotient vector space,
\[
   H^k = \frac{ Z^k }{ B^k },
\]
is defined.  This quotient is by definition the $k$-th  _deRham cohomology_.
We sometimes write it as $H^k_{DR}(M)$, distinguishing it from the
$k$-th singular cohomology group, $H^k_{sing}(M)$.

.Theorem {counter:theorem}
--
Integration defines a functorial isomorphism $H^k_{DR}(M) \map H^k_{sing}(M)$.

TO BE CONTINUED

and let $A^k(M)$ be the vector space of all
such forms.  Let $d\phi$ be the exterior derivative of $\phi$.
Thus, if $\phi = a(x_1\commadots x_n)$



and let $\sigma$ be a differentiable
chain of degree $k$.  The the integral
\[
    \int_\sigma \phi
\]
is defined.  If $\psi$ is a differential form of degree $k-1$, then
Stokes' theorem says that
\[
      \int_\sigma d\psi = \int_{\partial \sigma} \psi,
\]
where $\partial \sigma$ is the boundary of $\sigma$ and
where $d\phi$ is the exterior derivative.


\[
   \phi \mapsto \int \phi
\]
takes differential forms

the deRham theorem tells us that the cohomology groups of a differentiable
manifold can be computed as the quotient of the vector space
of closed differential forms by the exact forms:
\[
  H^k(M,\RR) = \frac{\text{closed $k$-forms}}{\text{exact $k$-forms}}.
\]
This assertion holds for both real and complex coefficients:
\[
  H^k(M,\CC) = \frac{\text{closed $k$-forms}}{\text{exact $k$-forms}}.
\]
where the forms in each case have coefficients in the given field.


In the case
of a Riemann surface we can expression complex-valued differential
one-forms in two ways.  The first is as linear combinations $du$ and $dv$,
where $u$ and $v$ are real coordinates, e.g., the real and imaginary
parts of a holomorphic coordinate $z$.  The second way is as
 linear combinations of $dz$ and $d\bar z$, where $z$
is a holomorphic coordinate.  If a one-form can be expressed locally
in all coordinate systems as $\phi = fdz$, then we say that it is of
type $(1,0)$.  A form that is locally given by $gd\bar z$ is said to
be of type $(0,1)$.  Such fancy terminology is not needed for
Riemann surfaces, but is required for varieties of higher dimension.
Thus, if $M$ is an $n$-dimensional complex manifold with local holomorphic
coordinates $z_1, \ldots, z_n$, then we can take wedge products
of $p$ of the $dz_i$ and $q$ of the $d\bar z_j$.  We say that such a
form has type $(p,q)$.  The set of $k$-forms which locally
has type $(p,q)$ is well-defined.  It is a vector space which we
denote by $A^{p,q}$.  This gives the _Hodge decomposition_ on the level
of differential forms:
\[
   A^k = \oplus_{p+q=k} A^{p,q}
\]
Let
\[
   H^{p,q}_{DR} = \frac{\text{closed $p,q$ forms  + exact $k$-forms}}{\text{exact $k$-forms}}
\]
This vector space is a subspace of $H^k_{DR}$; it depends only on the complex structure
of the underlying manifold.  However, it is emphatically _not_ true for general complex
manifolds, even compact ones, that the complex cohomology is the direct
sum of the Hodge spaces $H^{p,q}$.  We will discuss counterexamples in section
XX.

Let us now return to the case of elliptic curves.  As a differentiable
manifold, an elliptic curve $\EEE$ is isomorphic to a product of of
two circles: $\EEE = S^1 \times S^1$.  Let $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$
be angular coordinates on the first and second factor.  Consider the
$\RR$-vector space spanned by $d\theta_1$ and $d\theta_2$.
The exterior algebra on this vector space is a sub complex of the
deRham complex.

.  What is the zero element for the group structure on $\EEE$?  If $(z,w)$
is a point of $\EEE$, what is its additive inverse?

. Let $\EEE$ be as in the previous problem.  Let $a = 5$.  What is the
radius of the largest disk such that the parametrization $z \mapsto (z,\phi(z))$
discussed above is defined?  Same question for $z= \frac{1}{10}$.

. Determine the domain and range of the structure functions
\[
  g_{\alpha\beta} = f_\alpha^{-1}\circ f_\beta:
\text{subset of $U_\beta$} \map  \text{subset of $U_\alpha$}
\]
Explain why these are holomorphic functions.

. For the singular elliptic curve $\EEE$ given by $z^2 - w^2 + z^3 = 0$,
find analytic coordinates $(u,v)$ in a neighborhood of the origin such that
$\EEE$ is given by $u^2 - v^2 = 0$.
