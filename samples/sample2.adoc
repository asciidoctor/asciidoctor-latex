== Introduction

Twas brillig and the slithey toves
went the bar and had a blast.

Ho hum, ho hum, fee fie fo fum,
said the Jolly Green Giant.

== Technical matters

=== Arithmetic

First, let me say that stem:[1 + 1 = 2].  If you understand
this much, you have found the right path.  Now consider
this stem:[2^3 = 8].

=== Algebra

The name of our *much beloved* subject
comes from

* Italian
* Spanish
* Medieval Latin
* Arabic


The Arabic origin, _al-jabr_, is primary.
It signifies the reunion of broken parts, bone setting,
from _jabara_, reunite, restore. The original sense,
the surgical treatment of fractures, probably came
via Spanish, in which it survives; the mathematical s
ense comes from the title of a book,
ilm al-jabr wal-mukabala the science of
restoring what is missing and equating like with
like, by the mathematician al-Kwarizmi (see algorithm).

=== Binomial Formula



==== Exercise

[stem]
++++
 (a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2
++++


. Substitute $a = 1$, $b = 2$ in both sides
and verify that equality holds.

. Above is the binomial formula with exponent two.
What is the binomial formul for exponent three?

===== Comment

We are getting so deep in the nesting that this
is getting ridiculous!


====== Subcomment

And even more ridiculous still!!

== Matrices

[stem]
++++
M = \left[
  \begin{array}{ c c }
	 1 & 2 \\
	 3 & 4
  \end{array} \right]
++++



== Numbered equations


[stem]
++++
\begin{equation}
  a^3 + b^3 = c^3
\end{equation}
++++

By the way:  stem:[a < b < c].

== Things to do

Implement tables.  Such a pain in TeX, so much nicer in Asciidoc!

Also: we need to write a preamble and to
end the document properly.

PS.  We should handle both plain TeX and LaTeX.
