== Introduction

Twas brillig and the slithey toves +
went the bar and had a blast.

Ho hum, ho hum, fee fie fo fum, +
said the Jolly Green Giant.


WARNING: The Jolly Green Giant is good,
but he is often shadowed by the frumious
bandersnatch, who is very, very bad.

We will study the cubic equation $\ref{eq:cubic}$
later in this treatise.  The present cash
value of the equation is 50 dollars.

== Technical matters

=== Arithmetic

$1 + 1 = 2$

=== Algebra

The name of our *much beloved* subject
comes from

* Italian
* Spanish
* Medieval Latin
* Arabic


The Arabic origin, _al-jabr_, is primary.
It signifies the reunion of broken parts, bone setting,
from _jabara_, reunite, restore. The original sense,
the surgical treatment of fractures, probably came
via Spanish, in which it survives; the mathematical s
ense comes from the title of a book,
ilm al-jabr wal-mukabala the science of
restoring what is missing and equating like with
like, by the mathematician al-Kwarizmi[[alkwarizmi]] (see algorithm).

=== Algorithm

Nowadays [red]#algorithms# are implmented in `code`.

=== Binomial Formula



==== Exercise

\[
 (a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2
\]


. Substitute $a = 1$, $b = 2$ in both sides
and verify that equality holds.

. Above is the binomial formula with exponent two.
What is the binomial formul for exponent three?

===== Comment

We are getting so deep in the nesting that this
is getting ridiculous!


====== Subcomment

And even more ridiculous still!!

== Matrices

\[
M = \left[
  \begin{array}{ c c }
	 1 & 2 \\
	 3 & 4
  \end{array} \right]
\]



== Numbered equations

\[
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:cubic}
  a^3 + b^3 = c^3
\end{equation}
\]

The above is an equation.  Such equations were extensively treated in
the medieval Islamic period.  See <<alkwarizmi>> .

== Things to do

Implement tables.  Such a pain in TeX, so much nicer in Asciidoc!

PS.  We should handle both plain TeX and LaTeX.
