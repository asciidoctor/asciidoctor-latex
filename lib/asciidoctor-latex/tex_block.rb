# The purpose of the module TeXBlock is to
# transform structure of the form
# \[ ... \], either by passing them on unchanged
# or by stripping away the escaped braces.
#
# When ... is an environment such as
#
#     \begin{equation} ### \end{equation}
#
# the escaped braces must be stripped.
# All other cases, as far as I know now (not far:-),
# the braces remain.
#
# For the moment the solution is to strip when
# the contents ... contain no string of the form
# \begin{XXX} except for the cases in which XXX is
#
#    - array
#    - matrix
#
# I believe that the list of these keywords is small,
# whereas the number of other environments is large
# and essentially unbounded, since users can define
# their own environments.
