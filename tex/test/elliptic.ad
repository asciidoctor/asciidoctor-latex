== Elliptic Curves

Consider for a moment an _elliptic curve_ $\EEE$.  Such an object is given 
by an equation of the form
\[
   w^2 = p(z),
\]
where $p(z)$ is a cubic or quartic polynomial.  
Thus $\EEE$ is an algebraic curve 
in fact a projective algebraic curve.   
It is an algebraic curve of degree three,
meaning that a generic line $L$ intersects 
$\EEE$ in three points.  Any line
intersects $\EEE$ in three points counting 
multiplicity.  This fact allows
one to define the structure of a group on 
$\EEE$.  The addition lawis defined as follows.  
Given points $A$ and $B$ on $\EEE$, 
let $L$ be the line joining $A$ and $B$, 
and let $C$ be the third point in which $L$ cuts
$\EEE$.  If $C = (z,w)$, let $C' = (z,-w)$.  
Then $A + B = C'$ is the correct addition law.  
It is easy to see that it is commutative, and it
is not hard to find additive inverses, once one x
has found the zero element.
Associativity is what is difficult to prove.

=== Topology
As a topological space, an elliptic curve is a torus, as 
depicted in the figure below.  Its homology is generated by the two cycles
$\delta$ and $\gamma$.  Thus we have
\[
   H_1(\EEE, \ZZ) \cong \ZZ^2 = \ZZ\set{ \delta, \gamma}.
\]

=== Analytic Structure

An algebraic curve is also a _complex manifold_,
meaning that locally it is a manifold modeled on open sets in $\CC^n$.  An elliptic
curve is a complex manifold of dimension one, and so we may take the local
models to the disk, of radius $\epsilon$,
\[
  \Delta_\epsilon = \sett{ z \in \CC }{ |z| < \epsilon }.
\]  What this means
is that any point in $\EEE$ has a neighborhood which is parameterized by $\Delta$.
To see what this means in concrete terms, let $a$ be any point in $\CC$ which is
not a root of  the polynomial $p$.  Let $b$ be one of the two solutions of
the equation $w^2 = p(a)$.  Then $(a,b)$ is a point of $\EEE$.  Let 
$\phi(z) = \sqrt{p(z)}$ be the branch of the square root such that $\phi(a) = b$.
Then $z \mapsto (z,\phi(z))$ is a parametrization of  a neighborhood of $(a,b)$
by a neighborhood of $a$.  This parametrization has nonzero derivative at
each point of the neighborhood and so is a diffeomorphism.  Notice that
$z \mapsto (z, \phi(z))$ is the inverse of projection of $\EEE$ 
onto the $z$-axis.

When $a$ is a root of of $p(z)$, the construction just given does not give
a parametrization of a neighborhood of $(a,0$ on $\EEE$.
(Why?).  However, it turns out that the inverse of projection of $\EEE$
onto the $w$ axis does give the needed parametrization.  This is because
$p(z)$ has a simple zero at $z = a$ and so has an inverse function $q$.
Then 
\[
  w \mapsto (z,w) = (q(w^2)),w)
\]
is the required parametrization.  Notice that it has nonzero derivative near $w = 0$.

The parametrization just given is in terms of complex variables, and 
the parametrizing functions are complex analytic, i.e., holomorphic.
The complex variable $z$ can be written in terms of real and imaginary
parts as $z = u + \sqrt{-1}v$.  Then the parametrization can be written as
\[
   (u,v) \mapsto (u,v,\lambda(u,v), \mu(u,v),
\]
where
\[
  \phi(u,v) = \lambda(u,v)  + \sqrt{-1}\mu(u,v)
\] 
is the decomposition into real and imaginary part.

So far we have treated the real and complex manifold structures on 
an elliptic curve in terms of parameterizations.  The official treatment
is to use their inverse functions, which we refer to as _charts_.   If
\[
   z \mapsto (z,w) = (z,\phi(z))
\]
is a parameterization, then its inverse function 
is just 
\[
  (z,w) \in \EEE \mapsto z
\]
Via this chart we view $z$ as a  _function_ of points $(z,w)$ of $\EEE$.
We refer to $z$ as a _local coordinates_.

Suppose that we have charts
\[
   f_\alpha: U_\alpha \map V_\alpha \subset \CC
\]
When $U_\alpha \cap U_\beta \ne \emptyset$,  the compositions
\[
  g_{\alpha\beta} = f_\alpha^{-1}\circ f_\beta: 
\text{subset of $U_\beta$} \map  \text{subset of $U_\alpha$}
\]
are defined and holomorphic.  
These compositions are called _transition functions_.  They satisfy the 
identity
\[ 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:cocycle}
  g_{\alpha\beta}\circ g_{\beta\gamma} = g_{\alpha\gamma}.
\end{equation}
\]

The previous observation, which we make in the
context of an algebraic curve with charts coming from the parameterizations
given by projections onto the coordinate axes, is the starting point for
the abstract definition of a manifold.  We take as the given data a collection
of open sets $\set{U_\alpha}$ on a topological space $M$ and a set of
homeomorphisms $f_\alpha: U_\alpha \map V_\alpha$, where the 
$V_\alpha$ are open sets in real or complex Euclidean space ($\RR^n$ or
$\CC^n$).  We assume that the transition functions are of a given category:
 diffeomorphisms, holomorphic diffeomorphisms, etc.
We assume also that they satisfy the cocycle condition $\eqref{eq:cocycle}$.  Then 
we say that the charts define the structure of a differential manifold,
complex manifold, etc.

=== Singular Varieties

Consider an algebraic curve $M$ given by an equation $f(z,w) = 0$.
In the case of our elliptic curve, $f(z,w) = w^2 - p(z)$.
The  construction of charts or holomorphic parameterizations via
projections onto the axes and their inverses work in a neighborhood
of a point on $M$, provide that $\nabla f \ne 0$ at the point.
This is a consequence of the implicit function theorem.  A point
at which $\nabla f = 0$ is called _singular_.  A point at which 
$\nabla f \ne 0$ is called _non-singular_, or _smooth_.  If all 
points of $M$ are smooth, then we say that $M$ is smooth.  In that
case it is a complex manifold. 

As an example, consider the elliptic curve $\EEE$
with equation $x^2 - y^2 + x^3 = 0$.  The origin is a singular point.  In 
suitable analytic coordinates $u,v$ in a neighborhood of the origin,
$\EEE$ is given by the equation
\[
   u^2 - v^2 = 0
\]
Near the origin, $\EEE$ looks like the union of the lines $u = v$ and $u  = -v$.
This kind of singularity is called a _node_.  The other important type 
of singularity for elliptic curves is the _cusp_, with equation $w^2 = z^3$.

Both the node and the cusp are singularities of multiplicity two.  To define
multiplicity, consider a polynomial equation $f(z,w) = 0$ with $(0,0)$ as solution.
The 
\[
   f(z,w) = f_m(z,w) + f_{m+1}(z,w) + \cdots,
\]
where the $f_\ell(z,w)$ are homogeneous polynomials of degree $\ell \le d$
where $d$ is the degree of $f$.  The leading term has degree $m \ge 1$, and
that degree is by definition the multiplicity. The variety defined by 
$f_m(z,w)$ is the _tangent cone_ of $f = 0$ at the given point.  
Thus the multiplicity is just the degree of the tangent cone.

To understand the significance
of the tangent cone, consider  a parametric line 
$\phi(t) =(\lambda t, \mu t)$, and let 
 $f\circ\phi(t) = f(\lambda t , \mu t)$ be the composition with $f$.  Then
\[
   f\circ\phi(t) = f_m(\lambda.\mu)t^m + f_{m+1}(\lambda.\mu)t^{m+1} + \cdots
\]
If $(\lambda. \mu)$ is not a solution of $f_m(\lambda.\mu) = 0$, the
$f\circ\phi(t)$ vanshhes to order $m$. If $f_m(\lambda.\mu) = 0$, then
the composition vanishes to order greater than $m$.  In other words,
the tangent cone, viewed as a _projective_ variety, is the set of lines
which are "more tangent" to the variety at $p$ than a generic line through $p$.

For elliptic curves, the two kinds of tangent cones which appear are those
of the node and cusp, respectively.  The cones are a pair of distinct lines
in the first, and a doubled line in the second.


=== deRham Cohomology

The theorem of deRham tells us that the cohomology groups of a differentiable 
manifold can be computed as the quotient of the vector space
of closed differential forms by the exact forms:
\[
  H^k(M,\RR) = \frac{\text{closed $k$-forms}}{\text{exact $k$-forms}}.
\]
This assertion holds for both real and complex coefficients:
\[
  H^k(M,\CC) = \frac{\text{closed $k$-forms}}{\text{exact $k$-forms}}.
\]
where the forms in each case have coefficients in the given field. In the case
of a Riemann surface we can expression complex-valued differential
one-forms in two ways.  The first is as linear combinations $du$ and $dv$, 
where $u$ and $v$ are real coordinates, e.g., the real and imaginary
parts of a holomorphic coordinate $z$.  The second way is as 
 linear combinations of $dz$ and $d\bar z$, where $z$
is a holomorphic coordinate.  If a one-form can be expressed locally
in all coordinate systems as $\phi = fdz$, then we say that it is of
type $(1,0)$.  A form that is locally given by $gd\bar z$ is said to
be of type $(0,1)$.  Such fancy terminology is not needed for 
Riemann surfaces, but is required for varieties of higher dimension.
Thus, if $M$ is an $n$-dimensional complex manifold with local holomorphic
coordinates $z_1, \ldots, z_n$, then we can take wedge products
of $p$ of the $dz_i$ and $q$ of the $d\bar z_j$.  We say that such a 
form has type $(p,q)$.  The set of $k$-forms which locally
has type $(p,q)$ is well-defined.  It is a vector space which we
denote by $A^{p,q}$.  This gives the _Hodge decomposition_ on the level
of differential forms:

\[
   A^k = \oplus_{p+q=k} A^{p,q}
\]

Let 

\[
   H^{p,q}_{DR} = \frac{\text{closed $p,q$ forms  + exact $k$-forms}}{\text{exact $k$-forms}}
\]

This vector space is a subspace of $H^k_{DR}$; it depends only on the complex structure
of the underlying manifold.  However, it is emphatically _not_ true for general complex
manifolds, even compact ones, that the complex cohomology is the direct
sum of the Hodge spaces $H^{p,q}$.  We will discuss counterexamples in section
XX.  

Let us now return to the case of elliptic curves.  As a diffrentiable
manifold, an elliptic curve $\EEE$ is isomorphic to a product of of
two circles: $\EEE = S^1 \times S^1$.  
Let $\theta_1$ and  $\theta_2$
be angular coordinates on the first and second factor.  Consider the 
$\RR$ -vector space spanned by 
$d\theta_1$ and $d\theta_2$.
The exterior algebra on this vector space is a sub complex of the 
deRham complex.
