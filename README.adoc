== Introduction

Asciidoc-LaTeX defines an extended syntax
for the Asciidoc markup language
that closely parallels LaTeX for inline and display mathematical formulas and for environments.
Documents written in this extended markup language can be converted into  HTML or LaTeX:

Render as HTML::
Use `asciidoctor-latex -b html foo.adoc` to produce `foo.html`.

Render as LaTeX:: Use `asciidoctor-latex foo.adoc`
to produce `foo.tex`, then use `xelatex foo.tex` to create `foo.pdf`.

Below, we describe the main
features of {adl}.  However, since this document
will not render fully in GitHub, you
are encouraged to compile it yourself using
`asciidoctor-latex -b html README.adoc` or to consult the
http://vschool.s3.amazonaws.com/asciidoctor-latex/README.html[README at S3].
There is also an online version hosted at http://www.shoobox.io/share/230[shoobox.io],
a site for editing and distributing Asciidoc and Asciidoc-LaTeX documents.

Asciidoctor-LaTeX is developed by James Carlson, Jakub Jirutka, and Dan Allen.  Display of mathematical text
relies on http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/start.html[MathJax].

== Features

{adl} renders inline and displayed mathematical, and it supports a construct akin to LaTeX environments
for theorems, equations, etc.  These and other features are described briefly below and more fully in <<Asciidoc-LaTeX environments>>.

=== Inline and displayed formulas

ifdef::env_standard[]
.Example
Imagine that `foo.adoc` contains the text below.
The inline and displayed formulas will be correctly rendered as html or tex.
----
The formula $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$ relates the sides
and hypotenuse of a right triangle.  The formula
\[
\int_0^1 x^n dx = \frac{1}{n+1}
\]
is something we all learn in Calculus
----

----
  [env.theorem]
  --
 The Diophantine equation
 \[
    x^n + y^n = z^n
 \]
 for \$n > 2\$ has only trivial solutions

=== Click blocks

A click block displays its title but not its body.
If you click on the title, the body is displayed.
Click on the title again to hide the body.

The title of a click block is displayed in blue.

ifdef::env_standard[]
.Example

----
  [env.question]
  --
  What is the speed of light?
  --

  [click.answer]
  --
  300,000 km/sec
  --

== Installation

=== From Rubygems

Run `gem install asciidoctor-latex --pre` to install from
https://rubygems.org/gems/asciidoctor-latex[RubyGems.org].
See the https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-latex/blob/master/CHANGELOG.adoc[change log]
for a list of updates.

=== From GitHub

If you would like to install a development version from the repository, use:

 $ git clone https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-latex.git
 $ cd asciidoctor-latex
 $ gem build asciidoctor-latex.gemspec
 $ gem install *.gem


==  Contributing

If you wish to contribute to the
https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-latex[asciidoctor-latex project], you should set up your environments to use
Jakub Jirutka's https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-doctest[asciidoctor-doctest].  At the moment you will need to
use the https://github.com/jxxcarlson/asciidoctor-doctest[version which handles dialects] using
```
gem 'asciidoctor-doctest', github: 'jxxcarlson/asciidoctor-doctest', ref: 'latex'
```
in your Gemfile.  Run all tests with `rake doctest`,
or run individual tests with `rake doctest:html` or
`rake doctest:tex`.

At the moment the tests are for the latex dialect.

== Dialects

`Asciidoctor-LaTeX` processes three dialects of the core Asciidoc language:

- `asciidoc` (the core language)
- `manuscript`
- `latex`

`Asciidoc-latex` is the default dialect. Dialects can be set with the `:dialect` on the
command line as in this example:

```
   asciidoctor-latex -a dialect=manuscript foo.adoc
```
To set the dialect with the Ruby API, use for example :

```
   Asciidoctor.convert str, { 'dialect' => 'latex' }
```





== Macros

Macros can be included in the body of an Asciidoc-LaTeX
file using the `texmacro` environment, as in the example
below.

----

[env.texmacro]
--
\def\AA{\mathbb{A}}
\def\BB{\mathbb{B}}

\newcommand{\set}[1]{ \{\,#1\,  \} }
\newcommand{\sett}[2]{ \{\,#1\, \mid\, #2\, \} }
--
----

To include a LaTeX macro file MACRO_FILE, insert the code
`include_latex_macros::MACRO_FILE[]`.  Here MACRO_FILE can be a file name or a an absolute or relative path.  Included macros work
for both the html and tex backends.


NOTE: Automatic inclusion of the file `macros.tex`
has been discontinued.


== Switches

.Tex header
To generate a tex file with a minimal header, do:

 $ asciidoctor-latex -a header=no foo.adoc

.Print style
An alternate css file, `data/print.css` is provided
for printing.  It features wider margins and a smaller
type size.  Copy it to the root of your document
folder and use the command `asciidoctor-latex -a stylesheet=print.css`
or more generally `asciidoctor-latex -a stylesheet=path_to/print.css`.


{adlp}'s default form at is `:latexmath`.
To use `:stem`, put the text `:stem:`
in your file.  To turn the switch
on and set it to `latexmath`, say
instead of `stem:latexmth`.



== Document format

Asciidoctor supports two closely-related
math formats, [blue]#Asciidoc-LaTeX#
and [blue]#AsciiMath#.
In Asciidoc-LaTeX,
one can write `\$ a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \$` and
----
 \[
    e^{2\pi \sqrt{-1}} = 1,
 \]
----
for in-line and display mathematial
text, respectively.
You will need to express dollar-denominated
currency using
escaped dollar signs, as
 in the sentence, "He paid \$100 for that
theorem."  In AsciiMath, one writes
`+++stem:[ a^2 + b^2 = c^2 ]+++`
and
----
  [stem]
  ++++
    e^{2\pi \sqrt{-1}} = 1.
  ++++
----

ifdef::env_standard[]
== Asciidoc-LaTeX environments

Asciidoc-LaTeX supports an `env` construct that maps to LaTeX environments.
Thus
----
[env.theorem]
--
There exist infinitely many prime numbers.
--
----
renders as an automatically numbered theorem.
Environments can contain in-line and display mathematics, e.g.,
----
 [env.theorem]
 --
 A two-by-two matrix is invertible if
 its determinant is nonzero, i.e., if
 \[
  \left|\begin{matrix}
    a & b \\
    c & d
  \end{matrix}\right| \ne 0
 \]
 This result extends to $n\times n$ matrices.
--
----

There is complete freedom in parameter `NAME`
of `[env.NAME]`, Thus,one can write
----
 [env.definition]
 --
 An integer $n$ is *prime* if (a) it is not
 $\pm 1$ and (b) it has no divisors other
 than $\pm 1$ and $\pm n$.
 --
----
or
----
[env.joke]
--
A mathematician, a philosopher, and
a lawyer met at the local bar
for a drink.  The lawyer said ...
--
----
One can make cross references by labeling
the environment as in
----
[env.joke#mathjoke1]
--
A mathematician, a philosopher, and
a lawyer met at the local bar
for a drink.  The lawyer said ...
--
----
then referencing it later as  +<<mathjoke1>>+

Certain environments receive special treatment.
For numbered equations, use `[env.equation]`
like this

----
[env.equation]
--
a^{p-1} \equiv 1\ \text{mod}\ p
--
----

An equation number will be displayed only when
a label for cross-referencing is provided, e.g.,

----
[env.equation#little-fermat]
--
a^{p-1} \equiv 1\ \text{mod}\ p
--
----

For sets of equations, use `[env,equationalign]`:
----
[env.equationalign]
--
A & = 4\pi r^2 \\
V & = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3
--
----

a label for cross-referencing is provided, e.g.,

----
[env.equation#little-fermat]
--
a^{p-1} \equiv 1\ \text{mod}\ p
--
----

so that now one has

[env.equation#little-fermat]
--
a^{p-1} \equiv 1\ \text{mod}\ p
--

For sets of equations, use `[env,equationalign]`:
----
[env.equationalign]
--
A & = 4\pi r^2 \\
V & = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3
--
----
This text renders as
[env.equationalign#area-volume]
--
A & = 4\pi r^2 \\
V & = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3
--
